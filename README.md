Welcome to the **Pulsetab Extension Internship** repository! This repository marks the beginning of an exciting learning journey where we’ll collaboratively build a browser extension using **Angular** for the frontend and **Firebase** for the backend services. It will document individual progress, daily tasks, and collaborative contributions throughout the internship.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a learning and collaboration space for building a browser extension using Angular and Firebase. It tracks our daily progress, hosts setup tasks, and supports the development of frontend and backend features required for the final application.

### Focus Areas:
- Setting up and configuring Firebase services
- Securely managing user data
- Connecting backend functionalities to a frontend interface
