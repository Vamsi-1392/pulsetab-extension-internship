Welcome to the **Pulsetab Extension Internship** repository!  
This repository marks the beginning of an exciting learning journey where we’ll collaboratively build a browser extension using **Angular** for the frontend and **Firebase** for the backend services. It will document individual progress, daily tasks, and collaborative contributions throughout the internship.
